The application should contain the following validators:
	-> int validator
	-> float validator
	-> email validator
	-> date-time validator
	-> password validator -> is at least 8 characters in length
						  -> contains at least one uppercase letter
						  -> contains at least one lowercase letter
						  -> contains at least one digit character
						  
	The Validator component provides a set of commonly needed validators. It also provides a simple validator 
chaining mechanism by which multiple validators may be applied to a single datum in a user-defined order.
